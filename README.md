# Hymn - basically working in the 2-vat test cases. BROKEN due to lack of object encoding in Java, which I am working to implement.

9-layer decentralized protocol cloudstack talking ParrotTalk

The current use of ParrotTalk is with the Raven system, a promise-based distributed object implementation. I am working to bring ParrotTalk to Java and allow Raven to operate interdependently between Squeak, Pharo, Java and any other languages which can support ParrotTalk and STON. My latest efforts with Raven are to bring STON as the Layer 6 encoding.
